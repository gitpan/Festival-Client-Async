About
-----

This module provides a flexible interface for writing clients for
Festival speech synthesis servers.  It is not limited to speaking text
to the local audio device; rather, any Scheme expression can be
evaluated on the server and all types of results can be captured,
including evaluation results and waveform data.

It also provides both blocking and non-blocking modes of operation.
The latter is ideal for event-driven programs (such as Gtk+ or Tk
programs, or POE machines).

See the POD documentation included with the module for more information.

Installation
------------

In general, the following sequence of commands should be fine:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test
  make install
