Revision history for Perl extension Festival::Client::Async

0.0303 Tue Jan 15 15:44:06 EST 2002
	- Fix problems that happen when the stuff key gets split
	  between two chunks of data.

0.0302 Wed Aug 22 13:46:48 EDT 2001
	- Long time no see, eh?
	- Add parse_lisp() function
	- Fix testsuite
	- Make server_eval_sync() use the server_eval() core

0.0301 Thu Apr  5 14:38:47 EDT 2001
	- Argh!  Precedence lossage made server_eval_sync error returns break.
	- This version submitted to CPAN.

0.03 Tue Mar 27 11:55:07 EST 2001
	- First external release.
	- Revised the protocol handling significantly from previous
