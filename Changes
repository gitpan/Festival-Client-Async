Revision history for Perl extension Festival::Client::Async

0.03_01 Thu Apr  5 14:38:47 EDT 2001
	- Argh!  Precedence lossage made server_eval_sync error returns break.
	- This version submitted to CPAN.

0.03 Tue Mar 27 11:55:07 EST 2001
	- First external release.
	- Revised the protocol handling significantly from previous
	  versions.  This makes it a lot faster, though it
	  unfortunately broke some (wrong) assumptions in PoCo::Festival.
